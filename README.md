# Soulfull
Soulfull was an old roblox private server that had the clients 2020L and 2018L. Other planned (and removed) clients were 2014L and 2016L.
Soulfull has been since cancelled as of Early 2025 and is now opensource.

# Why?
Soulfull was not fun to work on for the past few months. The backend had turned into shit somewhere during Late 2024.
I planned to rewrite the src but I never got to doing that and even if I did the backend would become even more horrible to look at.

# Setup
I do not know how to setup Soulfull anymore as most of it's requirements are now lost to time (ex: arbiter, rccs..)
I also deleted some important files on purpose, as they are stuff I don't want public anymore.
And even then, I don't recommend anyone to use this, it's vulnerable and broken as hell.

So yes, that's it. Goodbye. Feel free to use this for research or something, I don't care
(The soulfulldbnew.sql is outdated by the way, the latest SQL file is lost to time)
